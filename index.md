## Introduction
The Annual COSMOS team meeting will be held in Japan. While the workshop will be focused on the COSMOS-Web NIRCAM and MIRI imaging large program, additional key projects to be discussed include the ALMA large program CHAMPS and the JWST IFU followup of ALPINE/CRISTAL galaxies. We welcome both the COSMOS team and external participants interested in COSMOS.
